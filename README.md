## Development Process
Throughout the development of this app, I learned how to effectively use React and its component-based architecture to create reusable code.

In addition, I learned how to work with JSON files and manage files within the project.

Overall, this project taught me valuable skills in web development, and I am excited to continue building and improving my abilities.
